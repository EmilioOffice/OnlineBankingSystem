# ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM IN C
This repository is a personal side project as part of my formation as a Software Engineer in my student years, focusing on the practice of logic for problem solving and some implementation of functions as part of public libraries such as "stdio.h" and many other used in the project for the managment of files, in this code I also used a data structure implemented to be more effective.
